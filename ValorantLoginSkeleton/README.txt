ValorantLoginSkeleton
---------------------

This is a minimal WPF (.NET 6) project skeleton with:
 - LoginWindow and SignUpWindow
 - SQLite local DB (users.db)
 - BCrypt password hashing

How to use:
1. Open this folder in Visual Studio 2022 (or later) using File -> Open -> Folder
   or create a new WPF project and copy these files into it.
2. Restore NuGet packages (BCrypt.Net-Next, Microsoft.Data.Sqlite).
3. Build & Run.

Customize:
 - Replace colors, fonts, and images with assets exported from your Figma prototype.
 - For a more complex app, add a main dashboard window and navigation.
